The example squash fs file is generate with the following commands from libsquashfs-ng:

gensquashfs -b 4096 -c gzip -D squashfs_example squashfs_example_gzip.sqshfs
gensquashfs -b 4096 -c zstd -D squashfs_example squashfs_example_zstd.sqshfs

The block size is chosen to be as small as possible to support multiple blocks with a small
 example file. It is not a recommendation for usage.
